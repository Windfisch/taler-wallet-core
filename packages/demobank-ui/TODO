Urgent TODOs:

- General:

  - not only Nora dark-theme, but default light! (CSS)
  - DONE: auto-focus on input fields is not working well
  - DONE: buttons should be visibly insensitive
    as long as required input fields are not
    working
  - DONE: next required invalid/missing input field is
    not properly highlighted in red
  - Logout button needs more padding to the right (CSS)

- Error bar:
  - DONE: hows JSON, should only show good error message
    and numeric code, not JSON syntax
  - should auto-hide after next action, no need for
    "clear"!
  - need variant "status bar" in green (or blue)
    which shows status of last operation

* H1-Titles:
  - Center more (currently way on the left) (CSS)

- Assets:

  - Numeric amount needs to be shown MUCH bigger (CSS)
  - Center more? (CSS)

- Payments:

  - Amount to withdraw currently shown in white-on-white (CSS)
  - Big frame drawn around notebook-tabs is not nice (CSS)
  - Center more? (CSS)
  - "Wire to bank account"
    - maybe split two types (payto and IBAN) into
      two tabs?
    - currently cannot switch back from payto to IBAN

- Withdraw:

  - Should use new 'status' bar at the end, instead
    of extra dialog with "close" button
  - ditto for bank-wire-transfer final stage

- Footer:
  - overlaps with transaction history or other
    content, needs to consistently show at the
    end! => change rendering logic!? (CSS?)
