GNU Taler Wallet
================

This repository contains the implementation of a wallet for GNU Taler written
in TypeScript.


Dependencies
============

In order to build the GNU Taler wallet, make sure that you have Node.JS and pnpm installed.


Installation
============

The CLI version of the wallet supports the normal GNU installation process:

  ./bootstrap && ./configure [ --prefix=$PREFIX ] && make install


Building the WebExtension
=========================

The WebExtension can be built via the 'webextension' make target:

  ./bootstrap && ./configure && make webextension

This will create the zip file with the WebExtension in the location

  packages/taler-wallet-webextension/taler-wallet-$VERSION.zip


Integration Tests
=================

This repository comes with integration tests for GNU Taler.  To run them,
install the wallet first.  Then use the test runner from the
taler-integrationtests package:

  cd packages/taler-integrationtests/
  ./testrunner '*'

The test runner accepts a bash glob pattern as parameter.  Individual tests can
be run by specifying their name.

To check coverage, use nyc from the root of the repository and make sure that the taler-wallet-cli
from the source tree is executed, and not the globally installed one:

  PATH="$PWD/packages/taler-wallet-cli/bin:$PATH" \
    nyc ./packages/taler-integrationtests/testrunner '*'
