GNU Taler Wallet
================

This repository contains the implementation of a wallet for GNU Taler written
in TypeScript.


Installation
============

The CLI version of the wallet supports the normal GNU installation process:

  ./bootstrap && ./configure [ --prefix=$PREFIX ] && make install


Integration Tests
=================

This repository comes with integration tests for GNU Taler.  To run them,
install the wallet first.  Then use the test runner from the
taler-integrationtests package:

  cd packages/taler-integrationtests/
  ./testrunner '*'

The test runner accepts a bash glob pattern as parameter.  Individual tests can
be run by specifying their name.
