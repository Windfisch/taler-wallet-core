# GNU Taler Wallet

This repository contains the implementation of a wallet for GNU Taler written
in TypeScript.


## Dependencies

In order to build the GNU Taler wallet, make sure that you have Node.JS and pnpm installed.


## Installation

The CLI version of the wallet supports the normal GNU installation process.

```shell
./configure [ --prefix=$PREFIX ] && make install
```

### Building the WebExtension

The WebExtension can be built via the 'webextension' make target:

```shell
./configure && make webextension
```

This will create the zip file with the WebExtension in the location

```
packages/taler-wallet-webextension/taler-wallet-$VERSION.zip
```

### Compiling from Git

If you are compiling the code from git, you have to run `./bootstrap` before
running `./configure`.


# Integration Tests

This repository comes with integration tests for GNU Taler.  To run them,
install the wallet first.  Then use the test runner from the
taler-integrationtests package:

```shell
cd packages/taler-integrationtests/
./testrunner '*'
```

The test runner accepts a bash glob pattern as parameter.  Individual tests can
be run by specifying their name.

To check coverage, use nyc from the root of the repository and make sure that the taler-wallet-cli
from the source tree is executed, and not the globally installed one:

```
PATH="$PWD/packages/taler-wallet-cli/bin:$PATH" \
  nyc ./packages/taler-integrationtests/testrunner '*'
```
