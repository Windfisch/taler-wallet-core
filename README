GNU Taler Wallet
================

This package implements a wallet for GNU Taler in TypeScript.

It can be run on different platforms:
1. As a cross-browser extension, written for the WebExtension API
2. As a Node.JS package


Dependencies
============

Dependencies are managed as NPM dependencies.  For performance reasons,
we use `yarn' as a replacement for `npm' in the build system.

For cryptographic operations, the wallet uses an emscripten-compiled
library.  The binary files for this library are in `./emscripten'.
The instructions for building this binary from scratch can be found
in the libtaler-emscripten repository:

https://git.taler.net/libtalerutil-emscripten.git/


pre-configure step
==================

`make submodules/init && make submodules/update`

or, at your choice:

`make self-strap`

In the following steps you can ommit
`--prefix=$PREFIX` if you have set
the environment variable PREFIX to an
existing path on your system.

Building from source (Web Extension)
======================================

Run `./configure --prefix=$PREFIX && make webex-stable'
to create an archive containing the extension
in ./build/taler-wallet-$VERSION.zip


Building from source (Node.JS)
======================================

Run `./configure --prefix=$PREFIX && make' to build the wallet.
The command line interface for the wallet is available
in `./bin/taler-wallet-cli'.


Installation
============

To install the package permanently on your system, run:

`$ npm install -g --prefix $PREFIX .``

The binaries will be installed to `$PREFIX/bin`.
