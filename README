This package implements a wallet for GNU Taler in TypeScript.

It can be run on different platforms:
1. As a cross-browser extension, written for the WebExtension API
2. As a Node.js package


Dependencies
============

Dependencies are managed as NPM dependencies.  For performance reasons,
we use `yarn' as a replacement for `npm' in the build system.


pre-configure step
==================

`./bootstrap`


Building from source (Web Extension)

to create an archive containing the extension
in ./build/taler-wallet-$VERSION.zip

The command line interface for the wallet is available
in `./bin/taler-wallet-cli'.
